# Final Project |  Disease Prediction and Self-Diagnosis 


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a supervised ML model to be able to predict risk of heart disases aith a self-diagnosis tool. 

## About the Dataset

Historical dataset about heart diseases obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease. 



## Models 

I used the following models in the Streamlit app:

-BernoulliNB : Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes Theorem with a strong independence assumption between the features.
It is suitable for classification of binomial data with discrete features.

-ExtraTreesClassifier : Ensemble method composed of a large number of decision trees, where the final decision is obtained taking into account the prediction of every tree.
